### TASK 1

EXTRACTING IMAGES FROM VEDIO FILE

The softwares used for this task are: python 3.6 and jetbrain pycharm community edtion.
The video files contained around 50,000 frames in it.The video file used was of the toll gate and consisted of vehicles such as car,big truck,small truck,van,jeep,bus etc.

### TASK 2

LABELLING OF IMAGES

The software used for this task is: Labelimg
The frames which were clear and accurate were sorted out.The sorted frames were taken and labeled using above software by creating rectangular boxes on the parts of vehicles such as wheels,front,entire vehicle.The vehicles present in consecutive lane were also labeled.
The XML files got created which consisted of image coordinates namely : xmax,xmin,ymax and ymin and further these coordinates were used as an input to the neural network to get get the required output.

### TASK 3

SEPERATING OF FRAMES USING PYTHON

The frames extracted using python code from the video file were separated into respective categories such as cars,trucks etc using python code.
The task became simpler by using this python code

### TASK 4

REAL TIME OBJECT DETECTION

With help of python code,real time object detection was done for videos and bounding boxes were created on the frames in real time with their names respectively.
 
### TASK 5
           
INSERTING WHITE NOISE TO THE FRAMES

With the help of python code white noise was added to the number plate images by adjusting the magnitude of noise as 0.05 and change was observed. 
The magnitude of the noise can be decreased and and increased by changing the magnitude of noise.
